## Digital Humanities
- What is Digital Humanities?
	- What do you think of when you hear Digital Humanities or Digital History?
	- What are you interested in hearing more about?
- Significance of showing the value of scholarship by making the work public.
	- Digital Humanities is often associated with the Open Access movement and Public Humanities.
- Digital Humanities as both how you do research and how you present it.
	- Tools and technology having an impact on the scholarship.
	- Being critical about how you do work and how it is presented.
