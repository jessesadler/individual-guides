## Digital Humanities
- What is digital humanities?
	- What do you think of when you hear digital humanities or digital history?
	- What are you interested in hearing more about?
- Significance of showing the value of scholarship by making the work public.
	- Digital humanities is often associated with open access and Public History.
- Digital Humanities as both how you do research and how you present it.
	- Tools and technology having an impact on the scholarship.
	- Being critical about how you do work and how it is presented.
